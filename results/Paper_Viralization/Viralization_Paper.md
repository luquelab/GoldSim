abstract: "We propose a binary metric to classify ecosystems into two different categories: viralized or microbialized ecosystems. An ecosystem is viralized when virions are more abundant than bacteria, and it is microbialized when microbes are more abundant. Our metric stems from the fact that bacteria and bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on earth and they can shape their environment by controlling the dominant metabolism. This metric can be easily measured in the field and in the lab. Quantitative metrics are critical for the practice of science, because they allow us to test hypotheses and rigorously classify entities in categories. Classifications in biological sciences are often subjective precisely because they are not based on objective metrics. Our metric stems from the fact that bacteria and bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on earth and they can shape their environment by controlling the dominant metabolism."

## Introduction

### Hypothesis and background

Our hypothesis is that all ecosystems can be classified into two categories: viralized or microbiolized ecosystems. Unlike other ecosystem classifications, this viral-bacterial dichotomy is an objective measurement in the sense that it is possible to measure the concentration of virus and bacteria in any given ecosystem.
Our metric is based on microbiologic activity, because microbes (bacteria, particularly), and viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. They have a big impact on upper levels of the trophic chain and also on abiotic factors, effectively shaping entire ecosystems. 

### Knowledge gap

Unlike commonly called hard sciences, there is a lack of objective metrics in biology. For instance, the concept of biological species was questioned by Darwin in The Origin of Species [@9934839413602122].

However, here have been several attempts to propose objective classifications in several problems of biology. A well known example is the Daisyworld [@https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0889.1983.tb00031.x] . More recently, and specifically to viruses, other dichotomies have been proposed such as the Kill-the-Winner/Piggyback-the-Winner dynamics [@Knowles2016].

### How to fill the knowledge gap

Here, we propose viralized-microbialized dicthomy: an objective, scale-free and binary metric to classify ecosystems. 
In our classification, viralized ecosystems are characterized by the dominance of bacteriophages with lytic activity and a catabolic metabolism, whereas in microbialized systems, phages are temperate, microbes are thus dominant, and there is an anaerobic metabolism.
Whether an ecosystem belongs to one category or the other can be determined by sampling the ecosystem and determining the Virus to Microbe Ratio (VMR), for instance.

## Discussion

### Conclusions

We have proposed a metric to classify ecosystems based on microbiolical factors.

### Caveats

Binary classifications are easily interpretable, but they are also arbitrary (where do we put the line?)

We have not considered other factors that could influence ecosystems. In other words, two ecosystems that are equally viralized or microbialized can be very different
