## Introduction

### Hypothesis and background

* Every ecosystem can be divided into microbialized and viralized. In viralized ecosystems, phages are virulent and lyse bacteria. This occurs because bacteria are producing ATP (catabolic environment) . In microbialized systems, phages are dormant, and bacteria grow fast and dominate. Anaerobic metabolism dominates.
Our hypothesis is based on the Daisyworld model.

### Knowledge gap
The impact of bacterial and bacteriophage activity on the biosphere has not been studied before

### How to fill the knowledge gap
We propose a scale-free classification of biological systems: any ecological system can be classified as viralized or microbialized

## Methods
