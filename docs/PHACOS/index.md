# PHACOS Experiment

## Corrected Hill function

The carrying capacity will be changed by a Hill function of eDAR. Recall that:

$$\begin{equation*}
eDAR=6 \frac{C_6H_{12}O_6}{O_2}
\end{equation*}	$$

However, a conventional Hill Function will not be realistic, because it requires eDAR to take values between 0 and infinite. This is not something to expect. The first question was, what are realistic minimum and maximum values of eDAR?
According to [Silveira et al, 2019](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49114), we have:

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
eDAR_{min}=0.24$\\
$eDAR_{max}=1.36$
\end{eqnarray*}	$$

Let us assume, for modeling purposes that:
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
eDAR_{min}=0.1$\\
$eDAR_{max}=1.5$
\end{eqnarray*}	$$
