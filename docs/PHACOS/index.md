# PHACOS Experiment

## Corrected Hill function

The carrying capacity will be changed by a Hill function of eDAR. Recall that
\begin{equation*}
eDAR=6 \frac{C_6H_{12}O_6}{O_2}
\end{equation*}	

However, a conventional Hill Function will not be realistic, because it requires eDAR to take values between 0 and infinite. This is not something to expect. The first question was, what are realistic minimum and maximum values of eDAR?
