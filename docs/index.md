This project aims at developing a series of standalone modules in [GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/) to model the microbiology of a coral reef.
The modules will be build under the orthogonal programming phylosophy developed by [David Thomas](https://pragdave.me/) and [Andrew Hunt](https://coralandphage.org/) in the [Pragrmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).

This project is supervised by [Toni Luque](https://www.luquelab.com) and [Forest Rowher](https://coralandphage.org/)
