Module 1 is more or less finished. Or it looks so.
I would need to find an average eDAR value to state that the metabolism is either anabolic or catabolic.

Now I need to connect two containers. I want to connect module 1 and module 2.

I will run some tests to see that the differential equations for photosynthesis/respiration work well.
For that, I will run the system for 24 hours with an hour resolution. If necessary I will increase the stock of all four
gases to make sure that things add up.
I will need to change things back if they work

Changes to do the respiration+photosynthesis test:
1. switch off the Oxygen runoff
2. Reduce simulation time from 200 to 48 hours
3. Do things at the hour timescale

For an additional test, I am going to increase the stock of O2 and sugar. Multiply by three.
It doesn't work. I multiply it by 10. Still does not work.

I believe what happens is a numerical artifact. If you have a pool that it's practically empty and ask it to outflow
the maximum stock available, then the pool is going to outflow the inflow that it gets. In the same time point. As a result,
you are going to see an empty pool all the time. However, that is more of a numerical artifact than anything else. The tank
is not empty, it is just outflowing at the same rate at it is inflowing. It is as if you had a pool with a pipe that pours
water and another pipe that drains it...and they do that simultaneously. You would need to have more inflow than outflow
to notice an oscillation in the stock of the pool. That is, you need a minimum amount of photosynthesis going on so that you
don't get the numerical artifact by which there is no O2 or sugar around.
